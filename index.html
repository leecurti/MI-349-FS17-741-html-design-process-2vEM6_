    <h3>Short Pitch</h3>
    <p>SpaceUmbrella is a company that believes in life beyond Earth. We leave our galaxy in order to find life.</p>
    <h3>Long Pitch</h3>
    <p>With all the Myths from different civilizations, we came to a proposal that all of those myths may have been real. Even though people do not see anything like that anymore, it is possible that those creatures from the myths are creatures that came to Earth from another planet outside our galaxy. That could either mean that the creatures are life with incredible intelligence so that they can build long distance spaceships or that those are only non-intelligent life that was sent up into space by creatures that are intelligent. Either way, they both support the proposal that their is life beyond Earth. </p>

    <h3>Personas</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><p>NASA is going to be involved with our project because of the similarities of our nature. They would use this page to see how long before we send our rocket up.</p></li>
      <li><p>Warner Brothers is going to support us with 100 million dollars in order for us to create our spaceships. They will monitor our budget spending on this page.</p></li>
      <li><p>The Space Ship company would be the ones who actually puts in the effort to create our spaceships. They would update their progress and set their goals on this page.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Comps</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><p>DIYSpace would compete in who would be the first company to find life on other planets. People would only remember the first person/company to find new things.</p></li>
      <li><p>LifeSearch is also building their own spaceships in order to find life, their purpose however is to colonize those planets and make those life their slaves.</p></li>
      <li><p>NASA has been thinking about sending out a exploration team for some time but has not had enough money support.</p></li>
